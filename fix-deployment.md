# 🔧 Quick Fix - Railway 502 Error

## ✅ Problem Identified
The `package.json` file had the wrong `main` entry pointing to `scripts/setup.js` instead of `webhook-server.js`. This has been **FIXED** ✅

## 🚀 To Deploy the Fix

### Option 1: Railway CLI (if you can login interactively)
```bash
# Open a new command prompt/terminal and run:
railway login
# Follow the browser login process
railway link [your-project-id]
railway up --detach
```

### Option 2: Git Deployment (Recommended)
If your Railway project is connected to GitHub:

1. **Commit the fix:**
```bash
git add package.json
git commit -m "Fix package.json main entry for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

2. **Railway will auto-deploy** the fix within 1-2 minutes

### Option 3: Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.com)
2. Find your project "vapi-nail-salon-agent"
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

**Before (causing 502):**
```json
"main": "scripts/setup.js"
```

**After (fixed):**
```json  
"main": "webhook-server.js"
```

Railway was trying to run the setup script instead of your webhook server, causing the connection failure.

## ✅ How to Test the Fix

Once redeployed, test with:
```bash
curl "https://vapi-nail-salon-agent-production.up.railway.app/health"
```

**Should return:**
```json
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}
```

## 🎯 Your Server Logs Look Perfect

The server logs show everything is working correctly:
```
🚀 Webhook server running on port 8080
📞 Vapi webhook URL: http://localhost:8080/webhook/vapi  
💾 Connected to Supabase: https://irvyhhkoiyzartmmvbxw.supabase.co
🏢 Default Business ID: 8424aa26-4fd5-4d4b-92aa-8a9c5ba77dad
```

## 🚨 If Still Getting 502 After Fix

1. **Check Railway variables** - Make sure environment variables are set
2. **Restart service** - Force restart in Railway dashboard  
3. **Check build logs** - Look for any build errors in Railway dashboard

The fix should resolve the 502 error immediately after redeployment! 🎉
