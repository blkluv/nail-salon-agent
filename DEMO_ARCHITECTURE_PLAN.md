## 🛡️ Cost Control Mechanisms

### 1. Call Volume Limits
- **Monthly Cap:** 50 demo calls max ($15 budget)
- **Daily Cap:** 5 calls max (prevent abuse)
- **User Tracking:** IP-based limiting (1 call per IP per day)
- **Auto-Cutoff:** Disable demo when budget reached

### 2. Demo Business Isolation
- **Dedicated Demo Business ID:** `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
- **Fake Appointments:** Pre-populated realistic schedule
- **Daily Reset:** Clear demo appointments at midnight
- **No Real Customer Data:** Completely isolated from production

### 3. Call Duration Limits
- **Max Call Length:** 3 minutes (force concise demo)
- **Auto-Hangup:** Agent ends call after booking or timeout
- **Guided Experience:** AI script optimized for quick demo flow

## 🎨 Demo Experience Flow

```
"See our AI in action! Call now and book a real appointment"
[Call +1 (424) 351-9304] [Watch Video Instead]

```

### Phase 2: Live Call
```
AI: "Hello! Welcome to Bella's Demo Nail Studio. I'm your AI 
     assistant and I can help you book an appointment right now. 
     What service would you like?"

User: "I'd like a manicure"

AI: "Perfect! I have availability today at 2 PM or tomorrow at 
     10 AM. Which works better for you?"

User: "Today at 2 PM"

AI: "Great! I'll book you for a classic manicure today at 2 PM.
     Can I get your name and phone number?"
     
[Booking process continues...]
```

### Phase 3: Real-Time Results

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### 1. Demo Business Setup
```javascript
// Create/update demo business with realistic data
const DEMO_BUSINESS = {
  id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
  name: 'Bella\'s Demo Nail Studio',
  phone: '+14243519304',
  assistant_id: '8ab7e000-aea8-4141-a471-33133219a471'
};
```

### 2. Call Limiting Middleware
```javascript
// Add to webhook server
app.use('/demo', rateLimiter({
  windowMs: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours
  max: 1, // 1 call per IP per day
  message: 'Demo limit reached. Try again tomorrow.'
}));
```

### 3. Demo-Specific Agent Context
```javascript
// Enhanced webhook for demo routing
if (businessId === 'demo' || phoneNumber === '+14243519304') {
  // Use demo business context
  // Add demo-specific instructions
  // Enable real-time dashboard updates
}
```

### 4. Real-Time Dashboard Updates
```javascript
// WebSocket connection for live demo updates
const demoSocket = new WebSocket('wss://demo-updates.example.com');
demoSocket.on('appointment_created', (appointment) => {
  updateDemoDashboard(appointment);
});
```
