## 4. Environment Variables

Add these to your Railway deployment:

   - Click "Add"
   - Repeat for `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` and `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`

## 5. Update Your Webhook Server

Add the SMS integration to your main webhook server:

```javascript
// In webhook-server.js, add at the top
const express = require('express');
const { addSMSWebhookToServer } = require('./production-templates/twilio-sms-integration');

// After creating your app and supabase client, add:
addSMSWebhookToServer(app, supabase);
```

## 6. Test SMS Functionality

### Test Outgoing SMS (Booking Confirmation)
```javascript
const { TwilioSMSService } = require('./production-templates/twilio-sms-integration');

const smsService = new TwilioSMSService();

// Test booking confirmation
const testAppointment = {
    customer_name: 'Sarah',
    customer_phone: '+1234567890', // Replace with your test number
    service_name: 'gel manicure',
    appointment_date: '2024-03-15',
    start_time: '14:00'
};

smsService.sendBookingConfirmation(testAppointment);
```

### Test Incoming SMS
1. Text your Twilio number: `+14243519304`
2. Send message: "book appointment"
3. Check your webhook logs for incoming SMS processing

## 7. Automated SMS Scheduling

### Set up Cron Jobs (Recommended)

Create a cron job file or use Railway's cron addon:

```javascript
// cron-jobs.js
const { SMSScheduler } = require('./production-templates/twilio-sms-integration');
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');

const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY);
const scheduler = new SMSScheduler(supabase);

// Run every day at 10 AM to send 24h reminders
async function dailyReminders() {
    await scheduler.send24HourReminders();
}

// Run every hour to send 2h reminders
async function hourlyReminders() {
    await scheduler.send2HourReminders();
}

// Run every 2 hours to send thank you messages
async function thankYouMessages() {
    await scheduler.sendThankYouMessages();
}

module.exports = {
    dailyReminders,
    hourlyReminders,
    thankYouMessages
};
```

### Railway Cron Setup
1. In your Railway project, go to "Settings"
2. Add a new service with type "Cron"
3. Set schedules:
   - `0 10 * * *` - Daily at 10 AM (24h reminders)
   - `0 * * * *` - Every hour (2h reminders)
   - `0 */2 * * *` - Every 2 hours (thank you messages)

## 8. Common SMS Commands Your Customers Can Use

| Customer Texts | System Response |
|---|---|
| "cancel" or "stop" | Cancels their next appointment |
| "yes" or "confirm" | Confirms their upcoming appointment |
| "book" or "appointment" | Directs them to call AI booking |

## 9. SMS Best Practices

### Character Limits
- Keep messages under 160 characters for single SMS
- Template messages are pre-optimized

### Compliance
- Always include business name
- Provide opt-out instructions ("Reply STOP to opt out")
- Include contact number for support

### Timing
- Send confirmations immediately after booking
- Send 24h reminders at 10 AM (not too early/late)
- Send 2h reminders only during business hours
- Thank you messages 2 hours after appointment
