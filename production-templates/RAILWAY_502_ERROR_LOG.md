# 🚨 RAILWAY 502 ERROR - TROUBLESHOOTING LOG

**Error**: HTTP 502 Bad Gateway  
**Service**: Railway deployment for Vapi Nail Salon Agent  
**First Occurrence**: March 26, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - August 26, 2025  

## 📋 ERROR SUMMARY

### What's Happening
- Railway deployment shows "successful" but returns 502 Bad Gateway
- Health endpoint returns 502: https://vapi-nail-salon-agent-production.up.railway.app/health
- Main endpoint returns 502: https://vapi-nail-salon-agent-production.up.railway.app/
- Railway logs show server starting but connection fails

### Root Cause Analysis
**IDENTIFIED ISSUE**: Package.json script mismatch  
- `"main": "simple-server.js"` (correct)
- `"start": "node webhook-server.js"` (WRONG - should be simple-server.js)
- Railway uses `start` script, not `main` field

## 🔄 ATTEMPTS MADE (CHRONOLOGICAL)

### Attempt #1 - Package.json Main Field Fix
**Date**: March 26, 2025 - 10:30 AM  
**Action**: Changed `"main"` from `"scripts/setup.js"` to `"webhook-server.js"`  
**Command**: `railway up`  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - 502 persists  
**Reason**: Railway ignores `main` field, uses `start` script  

### Attempt #2 - Express Version Downgrade  
**Date**: March 26, 2025 - 10:45 AM  
**Action**: Downgraded Express from 5.1.0 to 4.18.0 for stability  
**Files**: package.json  
**Command**: Railway dashboard redeploy  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - 502 persists  
**Reason**: Still using old webhook-server.js instead of simple-server.js  

### Attempt #3 - Created Simplified Server
**Date**: March 26, 2025 - 11:00 AM  
**Action**: Created `simple-server.js` with minimal Express setup  
**Features**:
  - Basic Express 4.18.0 setup
  - Health endpoint: `/health`
  - Root endpoint: `/`
  - Vapi webhook: `/webhook/vapi`
  - Better error handling
**Command**: Railway dashboard redeploy  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - 502 persists  
**Reason**: Package.json `start` script still pointing to webhook-server.js  

### Attempt #4 - Package.json Start Script Fix
**Date**: March 26, 2025 - 11:15 AM  
**Action**: Changed `"start"` from `"node webhook-server.js"` to `"node simple-server.js"`  
**Command**: `railway up --service vapi-nail-salon-agent --detach`  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - CLI permission denied, 502 still persists  
**Next**: Need Railway dashboard deploy + check what's actually running

### Attempt #5 - Connection Analysis
**Date**: March 26, 2025 - 11:20 AM  
**Action**: Curl verbose test to analyze connection  
**Finding**: Railway edge server responding but app not responding  
**Error**: "Application failed to respond" - server may not be binding to correct port  
**Next**: Check Railway logs + verify port binding

### Attempt #6 - Git Push Deployment with Minimal Server
**Date**: March 26, 2025 - 11:25 AM  
**Action**: Created ultra-minimal server.js (30 lines) and pushed via git  
**Changes**: 
  - Created server.js with basic Express setup
  - Updated package.json: `"start": "node server.js"` and `"main": "server.js"`
  - Git commit and push to trigger Railway auto-deploy
**Command**: `git push` (successful)  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - Still 502 after 15s wait  
**Finding**: Railway may not be auto-deploying or still using cached version  
**Next**: Check Railway dashboard manually + verify deployment triggered  

## 🔍 INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

### Key Discoveries
1. **Railway Priority**: Uses `start` script over `main` field
2. **File Confusion**: webhook-server.js (430 lines) vs simple-server.js (62 lines)  
3. **Version Issue**: Express 5.x may have compatibility issues
4. **CLI Problems**: `railway up` getting "Access is denied" errors
5. **Dashboard Works**: Railway web interface more reliable for deploys

### System Information
- **Platform**: Windows
- **Railway Project**: charming-flow
- **Service**: vapi-nail-salon-agent
- **Node Version**: >=16.0.0
- **Express Version**: 4.18.0 (downgraded from 5.1.0)

### Files Status
```
✅ simple-server.js - Created (62 lines, basic Express setup)
✅ package.json - Fixed main field and start script  
❓ webhook-server.js - Original complex server (430 lines)
✅ deploy-fix.cmd - Deployment script created
```

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS

### What We Know Works
- Server starts locally without issues
- Both simple-server.js and webhook-server.js run fine locally
- Railway deployment shows "successful" status
- Railway logs show server starting on port 8080

### What's Still Broken  
- 502 error on all endpoints
- Railway can't connect to the running server
- Health checks failing

### Next Steps to Try
1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Fix package.json start script
2. ⏳ **IN PROGRESS**: Deploy via Railway dashboard (CLI failing)
3. 🔄 **PENDING**: Test endpoints after deployment
4. 🔄 **PENDING**: Check Railway build logs for actual file deployment

## 🛠️ SOLUTIONS ATTEMPTED

### ❌ Failed Solutions
1. Changing package.json `main` field (Railway ignores this)
2. Downgrading Express version (not the root cause)
3. Creating simplified server (good practice but didn't fix Railway issue)
4. Using Railway CLI (getting permission errors)

### ✅ Potential Solutions
1. **Package.json Start Script Fix** - Most likely to work
2. **Railway Dashboard Deploy** - More reliable than CLI
3. **Port Configuration** - Ensure Railway port binding
4. **Environment Variables** - Check if missing vars cause 502

### 🚀 Working Solutions (To Be Confirmed)
- Fix package.json start script ✅ DONE
- Deploy via Railway dashboard ⏳ NEXT

## 📝 LESSONS LEARNED

### For Future Railway Deployments
1. **Always check `start` script** - Railway ignores `main` field
2. **Use Railway dashboard** - More reliable than CLI on Windows
3. **Test locally first** - Ensure server runs before deploying
4. **Check build logs** - Verify which files are actually deployed
5. **Simple servers work better** - Minimal setup reduces issues

### For 502 Error Debugging
1. **Check package.json scripts first** - Most common cause
2. **Verify port binding** - Server must listen on Railway's port
3. **Review build vs runtime** - Different issues at different stages
4. **Test health endpoints** - Simple way to verify connectivity

## 📞 EMERGENCY CONTACTS

### If 502 Persists
1. **Check Railway Status**: https://status.railway.app/
2. **Railway Discord**: Community support available
3. **Alternative Hosting**: Vercel, Netlify, Heroku backup options

### System Recovery
1. **Rollback**: Use git to restore working version
2. **Local Testing**: Ensure server works locally first
3. **Alternative Deploy**: Try different Railway service

## 🔄 UPDATE PROTOCOL

### When Adding New Attempts
1. Add chronological entry with timestamp
2. Include exact commands and file changes
3. Document result and reason for failure/success
4. Update lessons learned section

### When Error is Resolved
1. Mark status as ✅ RESOLVED
2. Document final working solution
3. Add to troubleshooting guide
4. Create prevention checklist

## ✅ FINAL RESOLUTION - August 26, 2025

### 🎯 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
**Primary Issue**: Procfile was hardcoded to `web: node webhook-server.js`  
**Secondary Issue**: Package-lock.json version mismatch (Express 5.1.0 vs 4.18.0)  
**Tertiary Issue**: Railway cached old configurations despite file updates  

### 🔧 SUCCESSFUL SOLUTION
**Step 1: Fix Configuration Files**
- Fixed `package.json`: `"start": "node server.js"`
- Fixed `Procfile`: `web: npm start` 
- Created `nixpacks.toml`: `cmd = "npm start"`
- Verified `server.js` binds to `0.0.0.0:${PORT}`

**Step 2: Fix Package Dependencies**
- Removed old `package-lock.json`
- Ran `npm install` to regenerate lock file
- Fixed Express version conflicts

**Step 3: Fresh Railway Deployment**
- Deleted old Railway service (to clear all cached configs)
- Created new Railway service from GitHub repo
- Added environment variables: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
- Updated Vapi webhook URL to new Railway service

### 🎉 FINAL RESULT
- ✅ **Health Endpoint**: https://web-production-60875.up.railway.app/health
- ✅ **Root Endpoint**: https://web-production-60875.up.railway.app/
- ✅ **Vapi Webhook**: https://web-production-60875.up.railway.app/webhook/vapi
- ✅ **Voice AI Phone**: (424) 351-9304 - OPERATIONAL

### 📚 KEY LESSONS LEARNED
1. **Procfile has highest priority** - overrides package.json start script
2. **Railway caches deployment configs** - sometimes requires fresh service
3. **Package-lock.json must match package.json** - version mismatches block builds
4. **Check build logs for actual command used** - `║ start │ ...` shows truth
5. **Test locally first** - server.js worked locally, confirmed code was correct

### 🚀 PREVENTION CHECKLIST
For future Railway deployments:
- [ ] Verify Procfile matches intended start command
- [ ] Ensure package-lock.json is in sync with package.json
- [ ] Check Nixpacks build output for correct start command
- [ ] Test server locally before deploying
- [ ] Consider fresh service for persistent cache issues
