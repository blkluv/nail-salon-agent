### How smart is the AI?

- ‚úÖ Book appointments for any of our services
- ‚úÖ Check availability in real-time
- ‚úÖ Answer questions about pricing and services
- ‚úÖ Send you confirmation texts immediately
- ‚úÖ Handle multiple customers at the same time
- ‚úÖ Speak naturally and understand different accents

### Is it really like talking to a person?
Almost! The AI sounds very natural and can have real conversations. Some customers don't even realize they're talking to AI until we tell them!

## ü§î Frequently Asked Questions

### Is the AI really available 24/7?
**Yes!** Unlike human receptionists, our AI never sleeps. You can book appointments at 3 AM on Sunday or during your lunch break - anytime that's convenient for you.

### Will a real person do my nails?
**Absolutely!** Only the booking is handled by AI. Your actual nail service is performed by our skilled human technicians, just like always.

### Is my information safe with the AI?
**Yes!** The AI uses the same secure systems we use for all appointments. Your personal information is protected and private.

### What if the AI doesn't understand me?
If the AI has trouble understanding, try:
- Speaking clearly and at normal speed
- Using simple phrases like "I want a manicure"
- If it still doesn't work, ask to speak with a person during business hours

### Can I talk to a human instead?
**Of course!** During business hours (Mon-Sat 9AM-7PM, Sun 10AM-5PM), you can always ask to speak with a staff member. Just say "Can I speak to a person?" and the AI will transfer you.

### Do I pay the AI?
**No!** The AI only books your appointment. You pay at the salon using your preferred method (cash, card, digital payments) just like normal.

### What if I need to cancel or reschedule?
For changes to your appointment:
- **Text "CANCEL"** to our number if you need to cancel
- **Call during business hours** to speak with staff for rescheduling
- **Visit in person** for complex changes

### Is my appointment really booked?
