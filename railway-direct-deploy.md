# Alternative: Railway Direct Deployment

Since GitHub is blocking, let's deploy directly to Railway:

## Option: Copy Files to New Clean Repository

1. Create a new folder: `vapi-nail-production`
2. Copy only these files:
   - `webhook-server.js` (production version)
   - `package.json` 
   - `package-lock.json`
   - `Procfile` (if exists)

3. Initialize new git repo:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Production webhook deployment"
   ```

4. Connect to Railway:
   - Create new Railway project
   - Connect to this clean repository
   - Deploy

This bypasses all the old commits with secrets!

## Or: Railway CLI Direct Deploy

If Railway CLI is working:
```bash
railway up --detach
```

This deploys directly without git.

The production webhook is ready - we just need to get it to Railway! ðŸš€
