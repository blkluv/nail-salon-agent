# CLAUDE.md - Project Memory & Best Practices

## Project: Vapi Nail Salon Agent
**Created:** January 2025  
**Updated:** March 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION READY - COMPLETE SYSTEM DELIVERED

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN: Core Logic First, Automation Later

### The Smart Build Order (What We Learned)

**Build your core business logic FIRST as a standalone webhook server, THEN add automation tools like n8n/Make/Zapier as a thin layer on top.**

### Why This Pattern Works

#### ❌ The Wrong Way (Starting with n8n/automation first):
```
Vapi → n8n (handles EVERYTHING)
         ├── Database logic (50+ nodes)
         ├── Availability checking (20+ nodes)
         ├── Customer management (30+ nodes)
         ├── Error handling (everywhere!)
         └── Complex spaghetti workflow
```
**Problems:**
- Debugging is a nightmare
- Logic scattered across visual nodes
- Hard to test
- Vendor lock-in
- Difficult to version control

#### ✅ The Right Way (Core logic first):
```
Step 1: Build Core Webhook ✅ COMPLETED
Vapi → Express Webhook Server → Supabase
         ├── checkAvailability()
         ├── bookAppointment()
         ├── checkAppointments()
         └── cancelAppointment()

Step 2: Add Automation Layer ✅ TEMPLATES PROVIDED
Vapi → n8n → Express Webhook → Supabase
        ↓
     Just adds:
     - SMS notifications
     - Email confirmations
     - External integrations
```
