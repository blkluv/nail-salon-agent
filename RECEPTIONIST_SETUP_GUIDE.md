## 🚨 Emergency Rollback

If anything goes wrong:

### Instant Rollback (30 seconds):
```bash
# 1. Disable all features
ENABLE_RECEPTIONIST_FEATURES=false
ENABLE_BUSINESS_TYPE_SELECTOR=false
ENABLE_CALL_LOGS=false
ENABLE_LEAD_MANAGEMENT=false

# 2. Redeploy

-- Only if needed (removes new tables)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS call_logs;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS leads;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS business_features;
ALTER TABLE businesses DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS business_type;
```

**Note:** New tables don't affect existing functionality, so database rollback usually unnecessary.
