# 🚀 Manual Deployment Steps - Fix 502 Error

## ✅ **Issue Fixed in Code**
The `package.json` has been corrected:
- ❌ **Before**: `"main": "scripts/setup.js"`
- ✅ **After**: `"main": "webhook-server.js"` 

## 🔧 **Quick Manual Fix Options**

### **Option 1: Railway Web Dashboard (Easiest)**
1. Go to **[Railway Dashboard](https://railway.com)**
2. Click on your **"charming-flow"** project
3. Click on **"vapi-nail-salon-agent"** service
4. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
5. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
6. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

### **Option 2: Force Upload via CLI**
Open a **new Command Prompt** and run:
```cmd
cd C:\Users\escot\vapi-nail-salon-agent
railway link -p charming-flow
railway up --service vapi-nail-salon-agent
```
When prompted, type **`y`** and press Enter.

### **Option 3: Delete and Re-upload Files**
If Railway Web Dashboard isn't working:
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Delete the current service
3. Create new service  
4. Upload your files again

## 🧪 **Test After Deployment**
Once redeployed, test with:
```cmd
curl "https://vapi-nail-salon-agent-production.up.railway.app/health"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2024-03-26T..."}
```

## 📞 **Your Voice AI Will Be Live At**
- **Phone**: (424) 351-9304
- **Webhook**: https://vapi-nail-salon-agent-production.up.railway.app/webhook/vapi

## ✅ **Why This Will Work**

Your server logs show everything is perfect:
```
🚀 Webhook server running on port 8080
📞 Vapi webhook URL: http://localhost:8080/webhook/vapi
💾 Connected to Supabase: https://irvyhhkoiyzartmmvbxw.supabase.co
🏢 Default Business ID: 8424aa26-4fd5-4d4b-92aa-8a9c5ba77dad
```

The **only** issue was Railway trying to run `scripts/setup.js` instead of `webhook-server.js`. Once redeployed, your Voice AI booking system will be **100% functional**!

## 🎯 **Final Test Commands**
```cmd
# Test health endpoint
curl "https://vapi-nail-salon-agent-production.up.railway.app/health"

# Test main endpoint  
curl "https://vapi-nail-salon-agent-production.up.railway.app/"

# Call the Voice AI (when working)
# Phone: (424) 351-9304
```

**Your system is ready to go live! Just need to redeploy with the package.json fix!** 🚀✨
