# Calendar Integration Strategy - DropFly AI Salon Platform

## Current Approach: Hybrid Solution ‚ú®

We provide **BOTH** options to maximize salon adoption and flexibility:

### Option 1: Built-in Calendar Dashboard üìä
**What We Provide:**
- Complete scheduling system in our admin dashboard
- Real-time appointment management 
- Staff scheduling and availability
- Customer history and preferences
- Mobile-responsive for on-the-go management

**Perfect For:**
- Salons wanting an all-in-one solution
- New businesses without existing systems
- Owners who want everything integrated

### Option 2: External Calendar Integration üîó
**Popular Integrations:**
- **Google Calendar** (most common)
- **Outlook Calendar** 
- **Apple Calendar**
- **Square Appointments**
- **Booksy**
- **Acuity Scheduling**

**How It Works:**
- AI assistant books appointments normally
- System automatically syncs to their preferred calendar
- Two-way sync: changes in external calendar update our system
- Staff can use the calendar they're already familiar with

## Technical Implementation

### Our Built-in Calendar Features
```sql
-- Our appointments table has everything needed:
appointments (
    appointment_date,
    start_time,
    end_time, 
    staff_id,
    service_id,
    status,
    customer_info,
    notes
)

-- Plus staff scheduling:
staff_schedules (
    staff_id,
    day_of_week,
    start_time,
    end_time,
    is_available
)
```

### External Calendar Sync Options

#### 1. Google Calendar Integration (Most Popular)
```javascript
// Google Calendar API integration
async function syncToGoogleCalendar(appointment) {
    const event = {
        summary: `${appointment.service_name} - ${appointment.customer_name}`,
        start: {
            dateTime: `${appointment.date}T${appointment.start_time}`,
            timeZone: appointment.business.timezone
        },
        end: {
            dateTime: `${appointment.date}T${appointment.end_time}`,
            timeZone: appointment.business.timezone
        },
        description: `
            Customer: ${appointment.customer_name}
            Phone: ${appointment.customer_phone}
            Service: ${appointment.service_name}
            Notes: ${appointment.notes}
            
            Booked via DropFly AI
        `
    };
    
    await calendar.events.insert({
        calendarId: business.google_calendar_id,
        resource: event
    });
}
```

#### 2. Outlook Integration  
```javascript
// Microsoft Graph API
await graphClient.me.calendars(calendarId).events.post({
    subject: `${service} - ${customerName}`,
    start: { dateTime: startTime, timeZone: timezone },
    end: { dateTime: endTime, timeZone: timezone },
    body: { content: appointmentDetails }
});
```

#### 3. Square Integration (For existing Square users)
```javascript
// Square API sync
await squareClient.bookingsApi.createBooking({
    booking: {
        appointmentSegments: [{
            serviceVariationId: serviceId,
            teamMemberId: staffId,
            startAt: appointmentTime
        }],
        customerNote: customerNotes
    }
});
```

## Onboarding Flow Integration

### Registration Step: Calendar Preference
```javascript
// During salon registration:
const calendarChoice = await inquirer.prompt([{
    type: 'list',
    name: 'calendar_integration',
    message: 'How do you want to manage your calendar?',
    choices: [
        'üì± Use DropFly built-in calendar (recommended)',
        'üìÖ Sync with Google Calendar', 
        'üóìÔ∏è Sync with Outlook Calendar',
        'üî∑ Sync with Square Appointments',
        'üìã Sync with existing booking system',
        '‚öôÔ∏è Set up later'
    ]
}]);
```

### Automatic Setup
```javascript
// Based on choice, we automatically:
switch(calendarChoice) {
    case 'google':
        await setupGoogleCalendarSync(business);
        break;
    case 'outlook':
        await setupOutlookSync(business);
        break;
    case 'square':
        await setupSquareSync(business);
        break;
    default:
        // Use built-in calendar
        await setupBuiltInCalendar(business);
}
```

## Competitive Advantage

### What Competitors DON'T Have:
‚ùå **No AI voice integration** with calendar sync
‚ùå **No real-time two-way sync** during phone calls
‚ùå **No instant appointment confirmation** via voice

### What WE Provide:
‚úÖ **AI books appointment** ‚Üí **Instantly syncs to their calendar**
‚úÖ **Staff updates calendar** ‚Üí **System knows availability**  
‚úÖ **Customer calls back** ‚Üí **AI sees latest schedule**
‚úÖ **Works with ANY calendar** they already use

---

## Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- Add calendar integration fields to businesses table
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN calendar_provider VARCHAR(50); -- 'builtin', 'google', 'outlook', 'square'
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN calendar_credentials JSONB; -- Encrypted tokens
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN calendar_sync_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN last_calendar_sync TIMESTAMP;

-- Track sync status per appointment
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD COLUMN synced_to_external BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD COLUMN external_calendar_id VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD COLUMN sync_error_message TEXT;
```

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Built-in Calendar ‚úÖ (Already Done)
- Complete appointment management in our dashboard
- Staff scheduling and availability  
- Real-time booking via AI assistant

### Phase 2: Google Calendar Sync üîÑ (Next)
- OAuth2 integration during onboarding
- Two-way sync (our system ‚Üî Google Calendar)
- Most salons use Google

### Phase 3: Other Integrations üìÖ (Later)
- Outlook, Square, Booksy integrations
- Based on customer demand

---

## Customer Messaging

### For Built-in Calendar Users:
*"Your AI assistant books appointments directly into your DropFly dashboard. Manage everything from one place - no external apps needed!"*

### For Integration Users:
*"Keep using your Google Calendar! Our AI assistant automatically adds bookings to your existing calendar. No workflow changes needed."*

---

## Revenue Impact

### Higher Conversion Rate:
- Salons can keep existing workflows = less resistance to switching
- "Works with your current calendar" = easier sales

### Lower Support Burden:
- Staff already know their calendar = less training needed
- Fewer "how do I use this?" support tickets

### Competitive Moat:
- Only AI booking system with native calendar integration
- Impossible for competitors to copy quickly (requires deep integrations)

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Built-in calendar** (current database supports this)
2. üîÑ **Google Calendar integration** (add to environment setup)
3. üì± **Calendar choice** in registration workflow
4. üîç **Test with real salons** to validate approach

**Bottom Line:** We provide the calendar they want - built-in OR integrated. This removes the biggest objection to switching systems.
