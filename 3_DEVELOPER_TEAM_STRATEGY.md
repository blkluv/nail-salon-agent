## üîÑ **COORDINATION PROTOCOLS**

### **DAILY STANDUP (15 minutes)**
**Time:** Every morning, same time
**Format:**
- **Developer #1:** "Yesterday I completed X, today I'm working on Y, blockers: Z"
- **Developer #2:** Same format
- **Claude:** "Integration status: X, conflicts resolved: Y, priorities today: Z"

### **BRANCH STRATEGY**
```git
main (protected)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/payment-integration (Dev #1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/payment-ui (Dev #2)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/email-marketing (Dev #1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/email-dashboard (Dev #2)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/sms-activation (Dev #1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/mobile-optimization (Dev #2)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/plan-enforcement (Claude coordinates)
```

### **MERGE PROTOCOL**
1. **Feature Complete** ‚Üí Create PR
2. **Claude Reviews** ‚Üí Technical review + integration check  
3. **Team Review** ‚Üí Other developer reviews for conflicts
4. **Integration Test** ‚Üí Claude runs full system test
5. **Merge to Main** ‚Üí Only after all tests pass

---

## üìã **SHARED RESOURCES & DEPENDENCIES**

### **SHARED FILES (Require Coordination)**
```typescript
// These files need careful coordination:
/lib/supabase.ts - Database client (all devs use)
/lib/supabase-types-mvp.ts - Type definitions (all devs update)
/.env.local - Environment variables (all devs need)
/components/Layout.tsx - Navigation changes (coordinate)
```

### **DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT**
**Dev #1 Blocks Dev #2:**
- Payment APIs must be ready before payment UI can be tested
- Email APIs must be ready before dashboard can send campaigns

**Dev #2 Blocks Dev #1:**  
- UI component interfaces affect API response formats
- Form validation requirements affect backend validation

**Claude Resolves:**
- Creates mock APIs so Dev #2 can work while Dev #1 builds real APIs
- Maintains integration test suite to catch interface mismatches

---

## üß™ **TESTING STRATEGY**

### **INDIVIDUAL TESTING (Each Developer)**
```bash
# Developer #1 (Backend)
npm run test:api
npm run test:integrations
npm run test:payments

# Developer #2 (Frontend)  
npm run test:components
npm run test:e2e:ui
npm run test:mobile

# Claude (Integration)
npm run test:full-system
npm run test:user-flows
npm run test:cross-browser
```

### **INTEGRATION TESTING (Claude Coordinates)**
```javascript
// test-complete-flows.js
describe('Complete User Flows', () => {
  test('Starter customer can book appointment with SMS confirmation')
  test('Professional customer can process payment and get email')
  test('Business customer can manage multiple locations')
  test('Plan limits are enforced correctly')
})
```

## üìà **PROGRESS TRACKING**

### **DAILY PROGRESS DASHBOARD**
```markdown
## Day X Progress

### üîß Backend (Dev #1)
- [x] Stripe test payment processing
- [ ] Square integration setup  
- [x] SMS sending functional
- [ ] Email templates created

### üé® Frontend (Dev #2)  
- [x] Payment form component
- [x] Mobile booking flow
- [ ] Email campaign builder
- [ ] Plan upgrade prompts

### ü§ñ Integration (Claude)
- [x] Payment flow end-to-end test
- [x] Database schema updated  
- [ ] Plan enforcement testing
- [x] Code reviews completed

### üö® Blockers
- Dev #2 waiting for email API completion
- Need staging environment for payment testing
```

### **FEATURE COMPLETION MATRIX**
```
Feature                 | Backend | Frontend | Integration | Status
------------------------|---------|----------|-------------|--------
Payment Processing      |   80%   |    60%   |     40%     | In Progress
Email Marketing         |   70%   |    90%   |     30%     | In Progress  
SMS System             |  100%   |    N/A   |    100%     | ‚úÖ Complete
Plan Enforcement       |   50%   |    50%   |     20%     | In Progress
Mobile Optimization    |   N/A   |    80%   |     60%     | In Progress
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **RISK MITIGATION**

### **COMMON CONFLICTS & SOLUTIONS**

**1. Database Schema Changes**
- **Risk:** Dev #1 changes schema, breaks Dev #2's queries
- **Solution:** Claude reviews all schema changes, updates shared types immediately

**2. API Interface Changes**  
- **Risk:** Dev #1 changes API format, breaks Dev #2's components
- **Solution:** API interfaces documented and locked before UI development

**3. Environment Variables**
- **Risk:** Different devs need different .env.local settings
- **Solution:** `.env.example` maintained by Claude, each dev has private .env.local

**4. Component Dependencies**
- **Risk:** Dev #2 updates shared component, breaks other features
- **Solution:** Shared components have comprehensive test coverage

### **BACKUP PLANS**
- **If Dev #1 falls behind:** Claude takes over backend tasks, Dev #2 continues UI
- **If Dev #2 falls behind:** Claude handles urgent UI fixes, Dev #1 continues backend  
- **If external service fails:** Mock implementations ready for continued development

## üí™ **TEAM SUCCESS FACTORS**

### **COMMUNICATION BEST PRACTICES:**
1. **Over-communicate Dependencies** - If you need something, ask immediately
2. **Document Decisions** - All architectural choices recorded
3. **Share Blockers Early** - Don't wait until standup if you're stuck
4. **Celebrate Wins** - Acknowledge when features are complete

### **CODE QUALITY STANDARDS:**
1. **TypeScript Strict Mode** - No any types allowed
2. **Error Boundaries** - All components have error handling
3. **Loading States** - No feature without loading indicators  
4. **Mobile First** - Test on mobile before desktop
5. **Accessibility** - Basic ARIA compliance required

### **DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:**
1. **Feature Flags** - New features behind toggles initially
2. **Gradual Rollout** - Test with subset of users first
3. **Rollback Plan** - Every deployment has rollback procedure
4. **Monitoring** - Error tracking and performance monitoring

---

## üéâ **BOTTOM LINE**

With 3 developers working in parallel on this plan, you can complete all missing features in **2 weeks** instead of 6-8 weeks solo. The key is:

1. **Clear ownership** - No overlapping responsibilities  
2. **Smart coordination** - Claude handles integration complexity
3. **Parallel workflows** - Backend and frontend work simultaneously
4. **Continuous testing** - Catch issues early
5. **Flexible adaptation** - Adjust plan based on progress

**This approach turns your 75%-complete app into a 100%-ready production system in just 2 weeks of focused parallel development!**
